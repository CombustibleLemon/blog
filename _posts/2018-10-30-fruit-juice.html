    One wonderful thing about my new homestay is that my host mother 
    makes fresh fruit juice regularly, nearly daily. It’s one of the
    only things contained in the small freezer, which is used as the
    only source of cold in the household. Throughout the day, I drink
    fresh and mouthwateringly tart tamarind and passionfruit juice.
    Passionfruit juice looks amost identical to orange juice, but
    brighter and more opaque. It is very sweet and a little tart.
    Tamarind juice is the complete opposite. It is brown and quite
    viscous, not unlike a smoothie yet incredibly tart, as if sucking
    on a lime. It has, however, a much richer flavor profile than the
    simple acidity of a cirtus, and I just can’t get enough.

    Outside the homestay, I have begun touring the Association for the
    Physically Disabled of Kenya. The Coast Branch of the organization
    has three separate facilities, one nearby and two elsewhere in
    Mombasa County. Yesterday I traveled by <em lang="sw"
    xml:lang="sw">matatu</em> (bus) to Port Reitz Rehabilitation
    Clinic, which houses children of all ages undergoing rehabilitation
    and surgery for club foot as well as other mobility-affecting
    disabilities. Because the children come from all over the coastal
    region and stay long-term, the facility also has a small school as
    well as recreational areas.

    Today I visited the Likoni Furkiture Workshop, also run by <abbr
    title="Association for the Physically Disabled of Kenya">APDK</abbr>.
    Getting there required boarding the free ferry to the south coast,
    where the expansive worksop sits high above a beach. While seeing
    the facility I met many of the residents, who live and work within
    the workshop. Several members were deaf, and I’m sad to say I have
    forgotten most of the little sign language I learned over the last
    couple years, save for spelling about half the alphabet. The
    furniture made at Likoni is of a very high caliber, and the prices
    reflect that. I saw a small, 1 <abbr title="square foot">sq. ft</abbr> wooden end table retailing for a staggering $120. I can’t imagine
    what the price of the luxurious Zanzibar-style living room set was.

    Coming home from work is a nice experience. It’s hot here &ndash;
    although surprisingly not (yet) hotter than Champaign-Urbana in
    July &ndash; so returning to chilled passionfruit juice is a
    sublime experience. My host family is very nice, and cook food
    almost constantly following the Kenyan mantra “if you leave food
    on your plate, then you didn’t like it; if you eat it all, you
    want some more.” Despite the arduous walk back through the heat
    and haggling bubblegum salesmen, my spirits are greatly lifted
    when I’m handed a bottle of ice-cold tamarind juice as soon as I
    step inside the house.&nbsp;&#10087;
