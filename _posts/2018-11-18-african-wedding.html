<p>
	This past weekend, I had the opportunity to attend a Kenyan
	wedding. The <em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> “bride”
	was my host mother’s neice, and I was thus able to enjoy a
	very involved view of the festivities.
</p>
<p>
	Weddings in Kenya are a huge deal. Everyone’s invited &ndash;
	and that means <em>everyone</em> &ndash; even passersby are
	welcome to walk into festivities. The wedding spanned two days
	&ndash; on Friday, the family of the
	<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> held a traditional
	<span lang="GIRYAMA">Giryama</span> wedding in the family’s
	homestead in Mariakani. The following day, everyone from the
	bridal party traveled to a town just north of Mombasa for the
	Catholic service.

	<h2>
		The Giryama Tradition
	</h2>
	<p>
		Inland an hour from Mombasa lies the industrial town of 
		Mariakani, home to the <span lang="nyf">Giryama</span>
		tribe of the <span lang="nyf">Mijikenda</span>
		(literally “nine&nbsp;villages”) peoples. A sizable proportion
		of Mariakani’s residents are employed full-time by local
		sheet metal and dairy factories, but many still keep
		livestock and operate small farms. My host mother grew up
		on a large homestead, with many siblings (I asked my host
		brother how many aunts and uncles he had &ndash; he just
		laughed). Today, the land has been
		divided up amongst those children who remain in Mariakani,
		with each nuclear family having a separate house. However,
		it is still considered one homestead, and the large extended
		family still acts as one.
	</p>
	<p>
		At <time datetime="2018-11-16T05:00:00+03:00">5
		<span class="time-delimiter">am</span></time>
		in the morning, my host brother James and I departed
		Mombasa for the bridal ceremony. My host mother had left the
		previous midday in order to prepare for the wedding, and did
		not want to burden me with sleeping on the ground without a
		mosquito net as she would have to. The buses in Kenya were in
		the middle of a minor strike, and so it took quite a bit of
		waiting around and haggling to get
		transportation to the rural village. Nevertheless, we arrived
		in Mariakani little more than an hour after leaving home.

	<p>
		Cutting through shrubbery
		to enter the homestead, I was greeted by several young adults.
		They would come to be the first of an incomprehensible count
		of James’s cousins. Cutting through yet another bush, I
		witnessed a familiar scene: atop a white-linen-covered dais
		sat two opulent chairs, facing a long red carpet stretching
		half the length of the homestead. In every direction were set
		up rows upon rows of folding chairs, underneath collapsible
		tents to guard against the beating equatorial Sun. James
		brought me into the childhood home of the
		<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em>, where I was served tea
		and a small breakfast.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once satiated, I was taken out to an open field behind the
		housing complex. Here too, plastic chairs littlered the view,
		everyone sitting in the shade of the trees overhead. Several
		hens wandered throughout the grass, pecking at sticks to find
		food for their loyally-following chicks. I was given a seat
		alongside two more of James’s cousins and two of his uncles.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not long afterward, the great event of the
		<span lang="nyf">Giryama</span> wedding ritual began &ndash;
		the arrival of the groom’s family. The party handed to my
		host mother a suitcase allegedly containing the bridal gown
		(today, the suitcase is empty as the 
		<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> has long beforehand
		picked out her dress) which she then carried above her head.
		The vibrantly-dressed women of the groom’s party surrounded
		my host mother, and
		the group marched towards the bride’s home. There, the 
		brothers of the <em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> had
		deadbolted the door, and demanded payment of $50 in order for
		the groom to take away their sister.
		Thus ensued a call-and-response shout between the bride’s
		male relatives and the groom’s female relatives, with my host
		mom standing right in the middle, sweating profusely from
		carrying the suitcase. After around twenty minutes, a deal
		was struck and the door was opened. The two families met
		indoors for the next few hours, preparing the rest of the
		wedding.

	<p>
		It quickly became apparent that more seating and serving
		dishes would be necessary to provide for the rapidly growing
		wedding attendees, and so I was whisked away to retrieve
		chairs from a neighbor. About three hundred feet down a dirt
		road was a small home with a yard containing a few banana
		trees and a roaming housecat. As I entered, a dozen children
		marched out of the front gate with chairs above their heads.
		I scooped up a few for myself and followed the gnome-like
		inverted chairs back to the celebration.
	</p>
	<p>
		Soon after bringing chairs over to the wedding, it was time
		to begin serving the food. All at once, the young men
		surrounding me stood up and converged behind the house.
		In a large enclosure were five enormous
		<em lang="sw">sufuria</em> “cooking vessels”, with a large
		team of professional cooks hard at work. The day beforehand,
		two cows were slaughtered and were tossed into the vats
		in their entirety, allowed to slow-cook overnight for a
		mouthwatering tenderness. With the efficiency of an assembly
		line, large two-foot-wide serving dishes were filled with
		golden rice and topped with a heap of beef and just a little
		bit of vegetables. People ran back and forth to lay out one
		hundred of these dishes in a grid on the ground, while the
		young men stood around like vultures. Once the mat was
		completely full, I expected everyone to grab one for himself
		and devvour the <em lang="ur">biryani</em> ravenously;
		however, the actual procedure was quite a surprise. One man
		yelled “go, go, go!” and the surrounding crowd descended
		upon the plates. Each man picked
		up not one but two serving dishes, and ran out towards the
		back hedge. An unfamiliar voice instructed me to “grab two
		and follow me,” which I complied with. Rather than eating
		first, the young men have the role of delivering the plates
		of food to everyone at the wedding. Each serving dish can
		feed three to five people, and so when I carried my red-hot
		metal dishes out to the back of the homestead, I found
		hundreds of children sitting cross-legged awaiting their
		delicious meals. Setting down the first
		<em lang="ur">biryani</em>, I felt relieved from the
		excruciating pain of the hot metal dish. But I soon
		realized it wasn’t even close to the end. My host brother
		waved me back to the outdoor kitchen, where there were
		just as many dishes as there had been when I left.
		We hadn’t even fed all the children, and there was still
		most of two cows stewing. I buckled in, and braced my
		hands for what became a half hour of running all across
		homestead with red-hot metal.

		A Catholic Rite
	</h2>
	<p>
		However, this particular
		wedding was unusual. The Catholic portion of the wedding
		was to be funded entirely
		by the family of the <em lang="sw">bwana&nbsp;harusi</em>,
		who are more reserved and decided to cap the
		attendance at 400 people. When I first heard this, I thought
		it was a reasonable cap &ndash; after all, I don’t know 400
		people I’d invite to my own wedding; however, it has not gone
		over well amongst friends & family, many of whom feel
		excluded.
