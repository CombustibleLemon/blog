<p>
	This past weekend, I had the opportunity to attend a Kenyan
	wedding. The <em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> “bride”
	was my host mother’s niece, and I was thus able to enjoy a
	very involved view of the festivities.
</p>
<p>
	Weddings in Kenya are a huge deal. Everyone’s invited &ndash;
	and that means <em>everyone</em> &ndash; even passersby are
	welcome to walk into festivities. The wedding spanned two days
	&ndash; on Friday, the family of the
	<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> held a traditional
	<span lang="GIRYAMA">Giryama</span> wedding in the family’s
	homestead in Mariakani. The following day, everyone from the
	bridal party traveled to a town just north of Mombasa for the
	Catholic service.

	<h2>
		The Giryama Tradition
	</h2>
	<p>
		Inland an hour from Mombasa lies the industrial town of 
		Mariakani, home to the <span lang="nyf">Giryama</span>
		tribe of the <span lang="nyf">Mijikenda</span>
		(literally “nine&nbsp;villages”) peoples. A sizable proportion
		of Mariakani’s residents are employed full-time by local
		sheet metal and dairy factories, but many still keep
		livestock and operate small farms. My host mother grew up
		on a large homestead, with many siblings (I asked my host
		brother how many aunts and uncles he had &ndash; he just
		laughed). Today, the land has been
		divided up amongst those children who remain in Mariakani,
		with each nuclear family having a separate house. However,
		it is still considered one homestead, and the large extended
		family still acts as one.
	</p>
	<p>
		At <time datetime="2018-11-16T05:00:00+03:00">5
		<span class="time-delimiter">am</span></time>
		in the morning, my host brother James and I departed
		Mombasa for the bridal ceremony. My host mother had left the
		previous midday in order to prepare for the wedding, and did
		not want to burden me with sleeping on the ground without a
		mosquito net as she would have to. The buses in Kenya were in
		the middle of a minor strike, and so it took quite a bit of
		waiting around and haggling to get
		transportation to the rural village. Nevertheless, we arrived
		in Mariakani little more than an hour after leaving home.

	<p>
		Cutting through shrubbery
		to enter the homestead, I was greeted by several young adults.
		They would come to be the first of an incomprehensible count
		of James’s cousins. Cutting through yet another bush, I
		witnessed a familiar scene: atop a white-linen-covered dais
		sat two opulent chairs, facing a long red carpet stretching
		half the length of the homestead. In every direction were set
		up rows upon rows of folding chairs, underneath collapsible
		tents to guard against the beating equatorial Sun. James
		brought me into the childhood home of the
		<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em>, where I was served tea
		and a small breakfast.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once satiated, I was taken out to an open field behind the
		housing complex. Here too, plastic chairs littered the view,
		everyone sitting in the shade of the trees overhead. Several
		hens wandered throughout the grass, pecking at sticks to find
		food for their loyally-following chicks. I was given a seat
		alongside two more of James’s cousins and two of his uncles.
	</p>
	<p>
		Not long afterward, the great event of the
		<span lang="nyf">Giryama</span> wedding ritual began &ndash;
		the arrival of the groom’s family. The party handed to my
		host mother a suitcase allegedly containing the bridal gown
		(today, the suitcase is empty as the 
		<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> has long beforehand
		picked out her dress) which she then carried above her head.
		The vibrantly-dressed women of the groom’s party surrounded
		my host mother, and
		the group marched towards the bride’s home. There, the 
		brothers of the <em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> had
		deadbolted the door and demanded payment of $50 in order for
		the groom to take away their sister.
		Thus ensued a call-and-response shout between the bride’s
		male relatives and the groom’s female relatives, with my host
		mom standing right in the middle, sweating profusely from
		carrying the suitcase. After around twenty minutes, a deal
		was struck and the door was opened. The two families met
		indoors for the next few hours, preparing the rest of the
		wedding.

	<p>
		It quickly became apparent that more seating and serving
		dishes would be necessary to provide for the rapidly growing
		wedding attendees, and so I was whisked away to retrieve
		chairs from a neighbor. About three hundred feet down a dirt
		road was a small home with a yard containing a few banana
		trees and a roaming housecat. As I entered, a dozen children
		marched out of the front gate with chairs above their heads.
		I scooped up a few for myself and followed the gnome-like
		inverted chairs back to the celebration.
	</p>
	<p>
		With everyone seated, it was time for the formalities. The
		groom and best man sat in two chairs, each wearing a red
		fez. Two chairs sat empty until two women, cloaked in 
		<em lang="sw">kanga</em>, were led out of the bride’s home
		and sat beside the groom. A sequence of elders &ndash;
		including my host mother &ndash; gave speeches to the four
		seated people in Swahili, of which I understood almost
		nothing. An older man held aloft a skewered coconut, split
		in half and filled with water, and had a small drink. He
		then spat the water behind the shoulders of each seated
		person, as blessings. Upon receiving all the necessary
		blessings, the groom was tasked with identifying which of
		the hooded figures was his
		<em lang="sw">bibi&nbsp;harusi</em> and which was her
		bridesmaid. I never got to see the result, but I know if
		he had chosen wrongly he would have had to pay a sizable
		fine to the bride’s family.

	<p>
		Soon after bringing chairs over to the wedding, it was time
		to begin serving the food. All at once, the young men
		surrounding me stood up and converged behind the house.
		In a large enclosure were five enormous
		<em lang="sw">sufuria</em> “cooking vessels”, with a large
		team of professional cooks hard at work. The day beforehand,
		two cows were slaughtered and were tossed into the vats
		in their entirety, allowed to slow-cook overnight for a
		mouthwatering tenderness. With the efficiency of an assembly
		line, large two-foot-wide serving dishes were filled with
		golden rice and topped with a heap of beef and just a little
		bit of vegetables. People ran back and forth to lay out one
		hundred of these dishes in a grid on the ground, while the
		young men stood around like vultures. Once the mat was
		completely full, I expected everyone to grab one for himself
		and devour the <em lang="ur">biryani</em> ravenously;
		however, the actual procedure was quite a surprise. One man
		yelled “go, go, go!” and the surrounding crowd descended
		upon the plates. Each man picked
		up not one but two serving dishes, and ran out towards the
		back hedge. An unfamiliar voice instructed me to “grab two
		and follow me,” which I complied with. Rather than eating
		first, the young men have the role of delivering the plates
		of food to everyone at the wedding. Each serving dish can
		feed three to five people, and so when I carried my red-hot
		metal dishes out to the back of the homestead, I found
		hundreds of children sitting cross-legged awaiting their
		delicious meals. Setting down the first
		<em lang="ur">biryani</em>, I felt relieved from the
		excruciating pain of the hot metal dish. But I soon
		realized it wasn’t even close to the end. My host brother
		waved me back to the outdoor kitchen, where there were
		just as many dishes as there had been when I left.
		We hadn’t even fed all the children, and there was still
		most of two cows stewing. I buckled in and braced my
		hands for what became a half hour of running all across the
		homestead with red-hot metal in hand. Everyone was having
		fun carrying the plates, and it was quite exciting. I still
		don’t know, however, how nobody else seemed to be treating
		their hands as if on fire.

	<p>
		Eventually, the food was dispersed. By the time we were
		finished serving, most of the children had eaten and sent
		their plates back to be washed. Yet another cousin of my
		host family’s ushered me into a dark hallway, where he and
		two others had stowed away two full plates of
		<em lang="ur">biryani</em>. After rinsing our hands, we dug
		in. Many foods in Kenya are eaten with the hands, and this
		was no exception. I would scoop up rice, pull a strip or
		two off the hunk of tender beef, and maybe get a little of
		the hot chili before forcing the formless mass down my
		gullet. Squatting above a cement floor with very little
		lighting, hands covered in rice and sauce, I ate without a
		doubt the best meal I’ve had in Kenya.
	</p>
	<p>
		With everyone full and excited, the friends of the couple
		gave brief speeches on the red carpet before the children’s
		favorite event: the cake-cutting. The bride stood up out of
		her seat and walked agonizingly slowly toward the
		three-level wedding cake. As I watched, I realized the top
		two levels were cardboard and the actual cake was much
		smaller than expected. The children certainly noticed as
		well, as I believe they inherently knew this would come
		down to a free-for-all to get a morsel of the sugary
		dessert. Sure enough, the kids had to be corralled into
		a line to get their one cubic inch of cake, and those in
		the back of the line came out quite unlucky.
	</p>
	<p>
		The live band struck a faster tune, and everyone went out
		into the central area to dance to the music. At one point,
		there was nothing but a solid mass of color as far as the
		eye could see. Everyone was quite jolly from both the food
		and the ample supply of palm wine, a bizarre (and 
		strikingly strong) alcoholic drink made purely from the
		raw sap of a palm tree left to sit for 24 hours. Sadly,
		the band had to leave by sundown, as the county government
		had a week beforehand outlawed live music at nighttime in
		order to curb teen pregnancy.
	</p>
	<p>
		In the evening, my host sisters arrived after a long day at
		work, and prepared for their roles at the following day’s
		ceremony. Long after the sun had set, James and I departed
		to return home to Mombasa for the night.

		A Catholic Rite

	        An invite-only reception caused quite a stir, so I’m told
	    </figcaption>
	</figure>
	<p>
		On Saturday, James and I again woke up early to attend the
		Catholic wedding service. This one was held in the town of
		Mtwapa, north of Mombasa and coincidentally where my
		classmate Alyssa resides. The directions weren’t exactly
		clear on the exact location, so my plus-one ended up
		arriving long before I did.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having staked out nice seats directly under a ceiling fan,
		Alyssa and I watched as the bridesmaids and groomsmen
		walked down the red carpet. Incomprehensibly, each of the
		seven pairs of people walked the length of the church
		stepping forward only an inch at a time, to some blaring
		pop song which the audio team couldn’t keep at a
		consistent volume.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you’ve ever been bored at an arduous religious service,
		try a Catholic wedding performed exclusively in a foreign
		language. I had no idea what was going on for the vast
		majority of the service. It was even hard to see the
		altar, as there was a team of cameramen across the red
		carpet loudly taking photos and even flying a video
		camera drone inside the church. Kenyans love
		weddings so much that they have a television show every
		Sunday displaying a different East African wedding, and
		this one was (un)lucky enough to be selected. The
		acoustics in the building were horrendous, so all I heard
		were camera shutters and the whirring of the drone.
		Nevertheless, I can’t exactly complain as I wouldn’t have
		understood the priest if I could have heard him. Only when
		the priest presented those bizarre wafers Catholics eat
		did I realize the service was wrapping up, and flowed out
		with the rest of the attendees.
	</p>
	<p>
		This particular
		wedding was unusual in that the reception
		was to be funded entirely
		by the family of the <em lang="sw">bwana&nbsp;harusi</em>,
		who are more reserved than the family of the bride.
		Since they were footing the bill entirely, they decided to
		cap the reception at four hundred attendees.
		When I first heard this, I thought
		it was a reasonable cap &ndash; after all, I don’t know 400
		people I’d invite to my own wedding; however, it has not gone
		over well amongst friends & family, many of whom apparently
		feel very much excluded.
	</p>
	<p>
		The reception was held at a quiet outdoor arboretum,
		with dozens of numbered round tables. Alyssa and I were
		directed to one of the first, and thus were relieved to
		be called first to go to the buffet. There was a large
		sampling of Kenyan meats there, and I ate so much I felt
		in pain for quite some time afterward. Even still, it
		did not compare to the village
		<em lang="ur">biryani</em>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Following some more speeches by friends and family,
		a second cake-cutting ritual commenced, this time with
		each attendee able to get at least one ration of a
		cubic inch of cake. As I turned to look around, I
		realized everyone had deserted the reception as soon
		as they got cake. I was very confused, as the sun was
		still high in the sky &ndash; the wedding couldn’t be
		over yet; after all, the celebration in Mariakani
		went from dawn to late at night. I checked with my
		host mother, who confirmed my suspicions. There was
		no dancing, no partying, just a rushed meal and
		then dispersal.
	</p>
	<p>
		In all, it was a spectacular experience and I hope I get
		the chance to attend a Kenyan wedding again in the future.
		I just wish I could have shown Alyssa the real party in
		Mariakani instead of the subdued church-service-and-meal I
		invited her to. Maybe next time.&nbsp;&#10087;
