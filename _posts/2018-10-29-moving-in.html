    Today begins the second half of my study abroad program.
    I am moving in with a new host family in the 
    port city of Mombasa and will tomorrow start my research
    internship at the Association for the Physically Disabled
    of Kenya. As I write this I’m sitting in my new bedroom
    in a house quite different from any place
    I’ve previously lived.
</p>
<p>
    This morning I was filled with apprehension, boarding
    an <time datetime="2018-10-28T08:00:00+03:00">8
    <span class="time-delimiter">am</span>
    </time> train in a daze. I trudged through a portion of
    a book to keep from <!--experiencing a full-blown panic attack
    in public--> worrying, maybe getting 70 pages in during the
    more-than-five-hour journey. It certainly didn’t help that
    my companion was ill and in no place to talk. Upon arrival,
    I was at least relieved by the familiar sight of the Mombasa
    rail terminus, and realized there was no turning back. Once
    again we drove through the coastal&nbsp;city, passing
    landmarks I recognized from my previous stay. It was at this
    point that I was informed my homestay was to be quite a bit
    more rural than I had previously experienced, which gave
    me quite a bit of both apprehension and curiosity.

    My host mother met me in the parking lot of a local mall.
    After saying goodbye to my classmate Alyssa and her own host
    mother, we departed for my new home. In contrast to my
    previous experience of Mombasa from within a five-star
    beach&nbsp;hotel, my new lodging was in a more
    densely-populated and more informally-constructed
    settlement. The houses in this area do not have running
    water, and are not self-contained insulated houses as one
    finds in most Western countries but rather a set of
    independent bedrooms opening up into a central patio area
    which is itself enclosed by the wall of a neighboring house.
    The bedrooms are fairly barebones, with mine containing a
    full-size bed topped with an ill-fitting mosquito net,
    a small desk with plastic chair, and 1 <abbr
    title="square foot">sq. ft</abbr> nightstand. A single fan,
    about two feet in diameter, provides my only cooling.
    Because there is only one electrical outlet, it cannot
    presently be operated simultaneously with a laptop charger,
    meaning I’m going to get quite hot if I try to work during
    the day. The central patio is densely utilized, with
    clotheslines above and kitchen equipment below. Everything
    sits out in the open, exposed to the light coastal breeze.
    The house’s front is a metal grille, as my host mother
    previously operated it as a small shop for necessities such
    as flour and toiletries. Today the storefront is boarded up
    and cobwebs take the place of toothpaste, but my mother
    remains hopeful she’ll someday be able to restart her shop.
    The house also contains a quaint living room, complete with
    one 10-inch television and a dozen portraits of Christ. This
    is where I enjoyed my first meal, very spicy <em lang="sw"

    xml:lang="sw">kachumbari</em>.

    After torturing my mouth with the first spicy food I’d had in
    a good while, I began to get acquainted with my new family.
    My mother was laying on a mat in the patio, having kicked off
    her shoes and enjoying the serenity of the open air. A light
    breeze provided respite from the beating equatorial sun,
    causing the clothes on the line, full of color and variety,
    to flap back and forth. Birds flocked to and fro the
    century-old mango tree that towers over the neighborhood as
    the only visible object looking up out of the patio.
    I was welcomed onto the soft mat, and a bottle of
    freshly-squeezed passionfruit juice was quickly whisked over.
    As I followed with my eyes a lone gecko wandering the walls,
    my mother vibrantly discussed her children's educations as
    much as she sought the story of my own. And, as has become
    custom during my stay in Africa, I responded to inquiry of
    how I was dealing with the tropical weather by regaling my
    hosts with an exaggerated rendition of the Chicago blizzard
    of '67. All three children are in post-secondary education,
    at varying levels. They are all quite driven, yet within the
    bounds of the relaxed pace at which most Mombasans prefer to
    live.

    Without running water, many of the practices to which I am
    accustomed require a bit more effort, yet it is not so
    different in practice. Squat toilets are the norm here, and
    it is necessary to pour out a cup of water in order to rinse
    the bowl after use. Showering is done by repeatedly pouring
    out a pitcher on my own head, and is somewhat pleasant as
    long as the water is warm. Handwashing is a bit awkward due
    to hands being the same appendages used to pour the pitcher
    of water for rinsing, but I’m sure I’ll get the hang of it.
    I guess running water isn’t all it’s cracked up to be.

<p>
    I really think I’ll like it here.&nbsp;&#10087;
